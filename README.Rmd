# aeolus

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of aeolus is to create better, more semantic linebreaks in your Markdown file.
aEOLus, get it? :wink:

## Installation

You can install the development version of aeolus like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Why have semantic linebreaks?

For any Markdown parser the two following code chunks are the same:

```md
This is a sentence. This is another
sentence.
```

```md
This is a sentence. 
This is another sentence.
```

However, the second one will make your work easier when you use version control.
Git treats code by **line** so if lines are logical units as opposed to random units
or units of a certain length, 
the Git diff is better. 

If you change one sentence in a paragraph, and that paragraph is a single line, 
the Git diff is less readable.

With semantic linebreaks, code suggestions in GitHub Pull Requests are easier to make and use.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(aeolus)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
