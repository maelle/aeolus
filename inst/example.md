This is a **sentence**. This is another [sentence](https://github.com).

In this paragraph
I made 
random line 
breaks. How annoying
is it?!

```md
This is a sentence. This is another
sentence.
```

This is a very long paragraph very very long without any breaks whatsoever which is sad, because who wants to get such a git diff.

1. thing
2. other thing

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

**What is wrong with bold text?** What?
