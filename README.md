The goal of aeolus is to fix Markdown files that have no semantic
linebreaks. aEOLus, get it? :wink:

## Installation

You can install the development version of aeolus like so:

``` r
pak::pak("maelle/aeolus")
```

## Why have semantic linebreaks?

For any Markdown parser the two following code chunks are the same:

``` md
This is a sentence. This is another
sentence.
```

``` md
This is a sentence. 
This is another sentence.
```

However, the second one will make your work easier when you use version
control. Git treats code by **line** so if lines are logical units as
opposed to random units or units of a certain length, the Git diff is
better.

If you change one sentence in a paragraph, and that paragraph is a
single line, the Git diff is less readable.

With semantic linebreaks, code suggestions in GitHub Pull Requests are
easier to make and use.

More information: <https://sembr.org/>.

## How to add linebreaks at the end of sentences?

1.  You can start doing it manually and make it a habit.
2.  You can use RStudio IDE’s Visual Markdown editor with the correct
    wrapping option:
    - Either run `aeolus::use_sentence_linebreaks()` for the current
      user (or `use_sentence_linebreaks("project")` for the current
      project);
    - Or, manually in the project/global options, choose “sentence” as
      value for “Automatic text wrapping (line breaks)” under “R
      Markdown”.

## How to fix a file that has no linebreaks at the end of sentences?

1.  Open it with RStudio IDE’s Visual Markdown editor with the correct R
    Markdown options (see previous section), then save.
2.  Use aeolus.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(aeolus)
markdown_file <- system.file("example.md", package = "aeolus")
readLines(markdown_file)
```

## Caveats

`aeolus::unleash()` uses the tinkr package under the hood, which means
it suffers from the same limitations: for instance, files after editing
only use “-”, not “\*“, for lists. Refer to [tinkr
documentation](https://docs.ropensci.org/tinkr/#loss-of-markdown-style).
We recommend using aeolus together with version control and reviewing
changes carefully before committing them.
